# Cognito Authentication.

In this lab, we will use the AWS Cognito service to add user authentication to a simple web API. The CDK stack will include the following key resources:

+ A Cognito User poo.
+ An Auth API to handle Authentication processing.
+ An App API to demonstrate public and protected routes/functionality.

![][arch]

The Auth API will provide endpoints (resources) that allow a user to issue the following requests:

+ SignUp.
+ SignUp confirmation.
+ SignIn.

### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. Import it into VS Code and type the commands
~~~bash
$ npm install
+ npm run schema
Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
The stack consists of a single S3 bucket, for now. In the management console, go to the S3 service:

![][bucket]

Note the bucket name in the terminal output as we will need it later:

![][terminal]

[arch]: ./img/arch.png
[start]: ./img/start.zip
[bucket]: ./img/bucket.png
