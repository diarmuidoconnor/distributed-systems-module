# Event Driven Architecture.


![][arch]


### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. Import it into VS Code and type the commands
~~~bash
$ npm install

Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
The stack consists of a single S3 bucket, for now. In the management console, go to the S3 service:

![][bucket]

Note the bucket name in the terminal output as we will need it later:

![][terminal]

[arch]: ./img/arch.png
[start]: ./img/start.zip
[bucket]: ./img/bucket.png
[terminal]: ./img/terminal.png
