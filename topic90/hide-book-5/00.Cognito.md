# Cognito Authentication.

This lab will use the AWS Cognito service to add user authentication to a simple web API. The implementation will provide the following aspects of an application's authentication requirements:

+ SignUP.
+ SignUp confirmation.
+ SignIn.
+ Protected app features.
+ Unauthenticated app features.

### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. Import it into VS Code and type the commands
~~~bash
$ npm install
+ npm run schema
Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
In `lib/auth-app-stack.ts`, create a stack consisting of a Cognito User Pool, an AppClient for this pool, and a skeleton REST API. In the management console, go to Cognito --> User Pools (left panel) to confirm the creation of the user pool:

![][userpool]

Notice in the stack class, we declared some private instance variables:
~~~ts
export class AwsServerlessAuthStack extends cdk.Stack {
  private auth: apig.IResource;
  private userPoolId: string;
  private userPoolClientId: string;
~~~
And initialized them in the constructor, for example:
~~~ts
    this.userPoolId = userPool.userPoolId;
~~~
These instance variables are accessible to any other method of the stack class. 
We will have several resources in the authentication web API with similar elements. A private method in the stack class will reduce code duplication. In `lib/auth-app-stack.ts`, define this method as follows:
~~~ts
export class AuthAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  private auth: apig.IResource;
  private userPoolId: string;
  private userPoolClientId: string;

  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    .... as before .....
  }

  private addAuthRoute(
    resourceName: string,
    method: string,
    fnName: string,
    fnEntry: string,
    allowCognitoAccess?: boolean,
    actions?: string
  ): void {
    const commonFnProps = {
      architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
      timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(10),
      memorySize: 128,
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X,
      handler: "handler",
      environment: {
        USER_POOL_ID: this.userPoolId,
        CLIENT_ID: this.userPoolClientId,
        REGION: cdk.Aws.REGION
      },
    };
    
    const resource = this.auth.addResource(resourceName);
    
    const fn = new node.NodejsFunction(this, fnName, {
      ...commonFnProps,
      entry: `${__dirname}/../lambda/auth/${fnEntry}`,
    });

  // if (allowCognitoAccess && actions) {
    //  fn.addToRolePolicy(
    //    new PolicyStatement({
    //      effect: Effect.ALLOW,
    //      actions: [actions],
    //      resources: [`arn:aws:cognito-idp:${Aws.REGION}:${Aws.ACCOUNT_ID}:userpool/${this.userPoolId}`],
    //    })
    //  );
    // }

    resource.addMethod(method, new apig.LambdaIntegration(fn));
  }  // end private method
}
~~~
You will note that a block of code in the method is commented out - this is intensional and we will enable it later.

Commit this work:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Setup for Auth APII."

### Verified Sender Identities.

By default, an AWS account is in __sandbox mode__. One consequence is that you can use the SES (Simple Email Service) to send emails to your verified sender identities only, with a typical limit of 200 emails daily. A verified sender identity is an email address or domain you confirmed ownership of. 

In this application, we want to email the user on signup. Therefore, you must first add the addresses to your verified sender identities. Follow the steps in [this guide][vsi] to create a  verified sender identity for any email addresses you can access.
