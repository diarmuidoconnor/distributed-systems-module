# Simple Serverless app.

You are required to design and develop a serverless REST API for managing movie review postings. The API will be hosted on the AWS platform, and your submission must include the infrastructure code required to provision the AWS resources using the CDK framework. 

The API should support the following endpoints:

+ POST /movies/reviews - add a movie review.
+ GET /movies/{movieId}/reviews - Get all the reviews for a movie with the specified id.
+ GET /movies/{movieId}/reviews?minRating=n - Get all the reviews for the movie with the specified ID with a rating greater than the minRating.
+ PUT /movies/{movieId}/reviews/{reviewerName} - Update the text of a review. (movie Id and reviewer name uniquely identify a review item)
 + GET /movies/{movieId}/reviews/{reviewerName} - Get the review for the movie with the specified movie ID and written by the named reviewer.
 + GET /movies/{movieId}/reviews/{year} - Get the review for the movie with the specified movie ID and written in a specified year.
+ GET /movies/{movieId}/reviews/{reviewerName}?language=code - Get a translated version of the review for the movie with the specified movie ID and written by the named reviewer.

Authentication. 
The app stack should include a set of endpoints to support user authentication. They should allow users to self-register, log in, and log out. 

Authorization.
Only authenticated users are allowed perform  
POST and PUT requests; GET requests are public.

Amazon Translate.
"Amazon Translate is a Neural Machine Translation (MT) service for translating text between supported languages .... enabling developers to build applications requiring support across multiple languages. The service can be used via an API, enabling either real-time or batch translation of text from the source language to the target language." AWS Docs

See this video for a demonstration.

Development strategy.
You should adopt an incremental approach to the development of this project. Each stage will involve the addition of infrastructure (CDK stack code) and backend functionality (Lambda functions)

The series of iterations could be as follows:

The CDK stack consists of just the DynamoDB table and seeding logic. No custom lambdas)
Add a REST API with one endpoint to return all the reviews for a movie. The CDK stack now has an API Gateway instance for the app, and the backend functionality consists of one lambda (lanbda A).
Extend the REST API to support the POSTing of new movie reviews and add the supporting backend lambda(Lambda B). Ignore validation of the POST body for now (optional).
 Expand lambda A to allow for query string parameters.
Extend the REST API to support GET requests for a review of a movie written by a specific reviewer. Add the associated lambda (Lambda C)
Add a second API Gateway instance for processing authentication.requests. Provide endpoints and accompanying lambdas for Registration, Confirmation, and Login. Suspend authorization handling until later.
Extend the REST API to support GET requests for a review of a movie written in a particular year. Add the associated lambda (Lambda D). Optionally, you could merge this functionality into lambda C.
Extend the REST API to support updates (PUT request) to a review's text. Add the associated lambda (Lambda E)
