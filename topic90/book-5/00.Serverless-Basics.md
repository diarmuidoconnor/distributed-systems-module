# Simple Serverless app.

You are required to design and develop a serverless REST API for managing movie review postings. The API will be hosted on the AWS platform, and your submission must include the infrastructure code required to provision the AWS resources using the CDK framework. 

The API should support the following endpoints:

+ POST /movies/reviews - add a movie review.
+ GET /movies/{movieId}/reviews - Get all the reviews for a movie with the specified id.
+ GET /movies/{movieId}/reviews?minRating=n - Get all the reviews for the movie with the specified ID with a rating greater than the minRating.
+ PUT /movies/{movieId}/reviews/{reviewerName} - Update the text of a review. (movie Id and reviewer name uniquely identify a review item)
 + GET /movies/{movieId}/reviews/{reviewerName} - Get the review for the movie with the specified movie ID and written by the named reviewer
  + GET /movies/{movieId}/reviews/{reviewerName}?language=code - Get a translated version of the review for the movie with the specified movie ID and written by the named reviewer.
