## Cleanup

To avoid incurring any cost, destroy the entire stack from your AWS account with the command:

```bash
$ cdk destroy
```

[Include the --profile option if relevant.]

Go to the CloudFormation service page on the AWS management console and confirm that the stack for this demo app has been deleted. Additionally, all related resources were deleted. For example, verify that the EC2 instance has been removed/terminated. Check some of the other resources as well.
