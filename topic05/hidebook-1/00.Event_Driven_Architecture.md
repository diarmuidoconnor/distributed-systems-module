# Event Driven Architecture.

In this lab, we will use a skeleton application as the context to demonstrate the message-driven or event-driven architecture style. The AWS services used will include S3, SQS (Simple Queue Service), SNS (Simple Notification Service), SES (Simple Email Service), Lambda, and DynamoDB. The app allows users to upload images file to an S3 bucket and subsequently add some additional metadata about the images, such as caption, photographer name, and date. Information about the images are stored in a simple DynamoDB table. The infrastructure architecture for the app is illustrated below:

Each user action causes a flow of messages through the app components and eventually trigger a lambda function execution.

__[NOTE: This lab work must be submitted to Moodle when completed. You must type the exact git commands provided during the lab as they form the basis for assessment. You should spread the effort required to complete the lab over the period provided. See below for submission details.]__

-----------------------------

### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. Import it into VS Code and type the commands:
~~~bash
$ npm install
$ cdk deploy
~~~
The stack consists of a single S3 bucket, for now. 

In the AWS management console, go to the S3 service:

![][bucket]

Note the bucket name in the VS Code terminal output, as we will need it later:

![][terminal]


In GitHub, create a new repository called 'eda-lab'. In VS Code, make this the remote origin repo:
~~~bash
$ git remote add origin [your repo URL]
~~~

### Submission.

Create a text file called 'eda-Lab.txt' and paste the URL of your repo into it. Submit the text file to Moodle at [this link][submit].
