# Serverless REST API.

In the previous lab we developed a simple serverless app where each lambda function had a unique URL. 
Now we want to achieve a more uniform entry to the lambda functionality by placing an AWS API Gateway between the client and lambdas. This results in a classic three-tier architecture (minus the frontend) but achieved with modern serverless technology.

~~~bash
$ npm install
Â£ cdk deploy

Check Cloudformation for the new stack:
