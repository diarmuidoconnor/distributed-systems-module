# Serverless REST API.

In the previous lab we developed a simple serverless app where each lambda function had a unique URL. 
Now we want to achieve a more uniform entry to the lambda functionality by placing an AWS API Gateway between the client and lambdas. This results in a classic three-tier architecture but achieved by modern serverless technology.

### Setup.

Download ann unzip [this archive][start]. It's the solution to the previous lab with some minor filename changes, e.g. lib/simple-app.ts renamed to lib/rest-api-stack.ts. Import it into VS Code and type the commands
~~~bash
$ npm install
£ cdk deploy
~~~
Check Cloudformation for the new stack:

![][stack]

Create a new folder (anywhere) called `simple-app`. Execute the following commands:
~~~bash
$ cd simple-app
£ cdk init app --language typescript
~~~
