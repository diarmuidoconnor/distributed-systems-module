## Interface Data Types.

In the project, create the folder `src`; inside it, make the file `01-basics.ts` and paste in the following Javascript code:
~~~js
// Add some of your friends below (optional)

const friend1 = {
  name: "Paul Fleming",
  phone: "087-12345",
  age: 25,
};

const friend2 = {
  name: "Jane Costello",
  phone: "086--12345",
  age: 31,
};

const friends = [friend1, friend2];
console.log(friends[1]);

//   -------------------
const colleague1 = {
  name: "Ralph Graham",
  department: "Engineering",
  contact: {
    email: "rgraham@company.com",
    extension: 121,
  },
};

const colleague2 = {
  name: "Patti Burke",
  department: "Finance",
  contact: {
    email: "pburke@company.com",
    extension: 132,
  },
};

const colleague3 = {
  name: "Dean Sullivan",
  department: "HR",
  contact: {
    email: "dos@company.com",
    extension: 125,
  },
};
export const colleagues = {
  current: [colleague1, colleague2, colleague3],
  former: [],
};

console.log(colleagues.current[0]);
~~~

Run this script:
~~~bash
$ npx ts-node src/01-basics.ts
~~~ 
Notice VS Code reports no TS compiler errors because all JS is valid TS:

![][noprob] 

However, we should make the code more type-safe. At the top of the file, add an interface declaration:
~~~ts
interface Friend {
    name: string;
    phone: string;
    age: number
}
~~~

___You are required___ to apply this data type declaration to all of the variable declarations that relate to friends in the script. Rerun the script to ensure it still works.

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added type-safety to friend data."
~~~

___You are required___ to use the same approach to the rest of the script, i.e. add typing to the colleague data. 

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added type-safety to colleague data"
~~~
