## Interface Data Types.

In the project crete the folder `src`, and inside it create the file `01-basics.ts`. Copy the following Jacascript code

~~~js
// Add your own friends below

const friend1 = {
  name: "Paul Fleming",
  phone: "087-12345",
  age: 25,
};

const friend2 = {
  name: "Jane Costello",
  phone: "086--12345",
  age: 31,
};

const friends = [friend1, friend2];
console.log(friends[1]);

//   -------------------
const colleague1 = {
  name: "Ralph Graham",
  department: "Engineering",
  contact: {
    email: "rgraham@company.com",
    extension: 121,
  },
};

const colleague2 = {
  name: "Patti Burke",
  department: "Finance",
  contact: {
    email: "pburke@company.com",
    extension: 132,
  },
};

const colleagues = {
  current: [colleague1, colleague2],
  former: [],
};

console.log(colleagues.current[0]);
~~~

Run this script:
~~~bash
$ npx ts-node src/01-basics.ts
~~~ 

Notice there are no TS compiler errors reported By VS Code:

This is because all JS is valid TS. However, we shoul make the code more type-safe. At the top of the file add an interface declaration:
~~~ts
interface Friend {
    name: string;
    phone: string;
    age: number
}
~~~

___You are required___ to appply this data type declaration to all of the variable declarations that relat to firends in the script. Rerun the script to ensure it still works.

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added type-safety to friend data"
~~~

___You are required___ to use the same approach to the rest of the script, i.e. add typing to the colleague data. 

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added type-safety to colleague data"
~~~
