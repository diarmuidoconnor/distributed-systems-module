## Type Aliases.

In `myTypes.d.ts` declare the following types at the end of the file:
~~~ts
export type Department = "Engineering" | "Finance" | "HR";
export interface ColleagueV2 {
  name: string;
  department: Department;    // *****
  contact: {
    email: string;
    extension: number;
    slack?: string;
  };
}

export type Buddy = Friend | ColleagueV2;
export type Administrator = Buddy | string | undefined

export type BuddyList = {
  name: string;
  administrator: Administrator;
  members: Buddy[];
};
~~~

The Department declaration above is termed a Literal Type. We could use it in our earlier declaration of 
Colleague data interface but that would cause compiler errors in lots of our existing code. Hence, we declared the ColleagueV2 interface, which we can use from here on. 

Create a new file `03-typeAliases.ts` and add the following code:
~~~ts
import {
  ColleagueV2,
  Friend,
  Buddy,
  BuddyList,
  Administrator,
} from "./myTypes";
import { friends } from "./01-basics";
~~~

Copy the colleague data from your `01-basics.ts` into `03-typeAliases.ts` but change the type to ColleagueV2, for example:
~~~ts
const colleague1: ColleagueV2 = {
  name: "Ralph Graham",
  department: "Engineering",
  contact: {
    email: "rgraham@company.com",
    extension: 121,
  },
};
~~~
Hover over the 'department' property and check its type - it should be Department.

Add the following code to the end of `03-typeAliases.ts`
~~~ts
function makeBuddyList(
  name: string,
  buddies: Buddy[],
  admin?: Administrator
): BuddyList {
  return {
    name,
    members: buddies,
    administrator: admin,
  } as BuddyList;
}

// Assumes you have variables called colleague1 and colleague2
const myFootballBuddies = makeBuddyList(
  "Football team",
  [colleague1, friends[0], colleague2],
  colleague1
)

const myBandBuddies = makeBuddyList(
    "Band team",
    [colleague1, friends[1]]
    // No administrator
  )

console.log(myFootballBuddies)
console.log(myBandBuddies)

function findBuddyContact(list: BuddyList, name: string): string | undefined {
  for (const buddy of list.members) {
    if (buddy.name === name) {
      if ("phone" in buddy) {
        return buddy.phone;
      }
      else {
        return buddy.contact.email;
      }
    }
    return undefined;
  }
}
console.log("Contact buddy at: ", findBuddyContact(myFootballBuddies, "Ralph Graham"));
~~~
In the 'makeBuddyList' function we use the __as operator__ to cast the returned object to a BuddyList type for safety. Casting can be used to 'help' the compiler with associating a type to an obkect in in special cases. In the above case it is actually optional. 

The 'findBuddyContact' function iterates over the members of a BuddyList looking for a Buddy with a specified name. If found, it determines the buddy type and returns their contact information. The phone number is returned for the Friend type, and the email is returned for ColleagueV2 type. The process of determining the type of the Buddy is termed __type narrowing__. Note how the compiler identifies the correct narrowed type:

![][narrow1] 

![][narrow2] 


Run the `03-typeAliases.ts` script to ensure you understand it.

__You are required__ to write a function that returns all the Friends in a buddy list. Its signature should be:
~~~ts
function getBuddyListFriends(list: BuddyList): Friend[] {

~~~
[Hint: Use the array filter method in the solution.]
