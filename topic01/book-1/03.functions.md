## TS functions.

### Setup.
Create the file `src/myTypes.d.ts` and add the following declarations:
~~~ts

export interface Friend {
    name: string;
    phone: string;
    age: number
}

export interface Colleague {
    name: string;
    department: string;
    contact: {
      email: string;
      extension: number
    } 
  }
~~~
In `01-basics.ts` make the following changes: 
+ Add an import:
~~~ts
import {Friend, Colleague } from './myTypes'
~~~
+ Remove the two redundant interface declarations.
+ Comment out all the 'console.log()` statements.
+ Export the data arrays:
~~~ts
export const friends = [friend1, friend2];

export const colleagues = { ... as before ...};
~~~

Create the file `src/02-functions.ts` and add this line:
~~~ts
import {Friend, Colleague } from './myTypes'
~~~

### Simple functions.

Add the following code to `02-functions.ts`:
~~~ts
import {friends} from './01-basics'

function older(f: Friend) : string {
     f.age += 1
     return `${f.name} is now ${f.age}` 
}

console.log(older(friends[0]))
~~~
Note the function's parameter type and return type. Run the script:
~~~bash
$ npx ts-node  src/02-functions.ts 
~~~

__You are required to__ add a new function, called 'allOlder', that takes an array of friend objects, increments each ones age by one year, and returns the new ages as an array of strings. For example, the statement:
~~~ts
console.log(allOlder(friends))
~~~
would output:
~~~bash
[ 'Paul Fleming is now 27', 'Jane Costello is now 32' ]
~~~

Add the following code to the end of the file:
~~~ts
function highestExtension(cs: Colleague[]): Colleague {
  const result = cs.sort(
    (c1, c2) => c1.contact.extension - c2.contact.extension
  );
  return result[cs.length - 1];
}
console.log(highestExtension(colleagues.current));
~~~

The 'highestExtension' function returns the colleague with the highest extension number so far. Run the script to confirm it works.

__You are required to__wrute a function, called 'addColleague' that adds a colleague to an array, where their extensins number is to one plus the highest extension so far. To test your implementation, add the following code to the script:
~~~ts
addColleague(colleagues.current, "Sheild O Connell", "HR", "soc@here.com");
console.log(colleagues.current.filter((c) => c.name === "Sheild O Connell"));
~~~
It should output the following:
~~~bash
[
  {
    name: 'Sheild O Connell',
    department: 'HR',
    contact: { email: 'soc@here.com', extension: 133 }
  }
]
~~~
