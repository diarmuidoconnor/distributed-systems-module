**[NOTE: This lab work must be submitted to Moodle when completed. You must type the exact Git commands provided during the lab as they form the basis for assessment. You must spread the effort required to complete the lab over the period involved; do not cram the work into a few days just before the deadline, as this is not conducive to proper learning and will result in a minimal mark. See below for submission details.]**

---

Create a new folder called `typescriptLab`. Open a terminal/shell window and navigate to the new folder using the cd command. Now type the following setup command sequence:

```bash
$ npm init (Accept the defaults in most cases)
$ npm install -D typescript@5.7.3
$ npm install -D ts-node
$ npx tsc --init (This creates a default tsconfig.json file)
$ git init
```

Import the `typescriptLab` folder into VS Code and create a `.gitignore` file with the following content:

```
/node_modules
.vscode
```

Open an integrated terminal panel in VS Code by clicking the Terminal drop-down menu and selecting New Terminal. Type the following commands at the terminal prompt:

```bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Initial structure."
$ git branch -M main
```

In GitHub, create a new repository called 'ds-ts-lab'. In VS Code, make this a remote repository for the typescriptLab project using the command:

```bash
$ git remote add origin [your repo URL]
$ git push origin main
```
### Submission.

Create a text file called 'tsLabWork.txt' and paste the URL of your GitHub repo into it. Log in to Moodle and submit the text file at [this link][submit].
