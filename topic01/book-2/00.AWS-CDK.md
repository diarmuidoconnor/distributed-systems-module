# The Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) lets you define cloud infrastructure as code in various programming languages - we will use Typescript.

## Prerequisites.

[This module assumes you have an AWS account.]

To use the CDK toolkit, your local development environment must include the following:

+ The AWS CLI (version 2). To check if it's already installed, type the command:
~~~bash
$ aws --version
~~~
If not installed, see [here][aws] for instructions.

+ The Docker Engine. Please ensure you install the Desktop version. See [here][docker] for instructions.

## CDK Setup.

Install the AWS CDK Toolkit globally using the following command (use the VS Code integrated terminal for convenience):
~~~bash
$ npm install -g aws-cdk@2.80.0
~~~
Run the following command to verify a correct installation:
~~~bash
$ cdk --version
~~~

To deploy stacks using the AWS CDK, your AWS account requires dedicated S3 buckets and other containers to be available - AWS CloudFormation uses them during deployment. Creating these is called __bootstrapping__. First, you need to discover the 12-digit identification number for your AWS account using the following command:
~~~bash
$ aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text
~~~
Now bootstrap your AWS account with the following command:
~~~bash
$ cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR-ACCOUNT-NUMBER/eu-west-1
~~~
>>e.g. cdk bootstrap aws://123456789012/eu-west-1

Confirm that this worked by navigating to the CloudFormation service in the AWS web management console and checking for the presence of the CDKToolkit stack:

The command also creates an S3 bucket to store assets required by the CDK. __NEVER DELETE__ any resources created by the bootstrapping process.
