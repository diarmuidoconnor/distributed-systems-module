# ALB-EC2 stack

The objective is to deploy the following application stack to your AWS account:

![][schema]

The EC2 instance will host a Web API built on a Node and Express platform. The API communicates with a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB.com. The database is already created and set up with user access credentials for your convenience.

The code for this stack can be cloned from [here](https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI)

>>$ git clone https://github.com/diarmuidoconnor/cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI

Import the `cdk-alb-ec2-webAPI)` folder into VS Code, open an integrated terminal, and install the  dependencies:
~~~bash
$ npm install
~~~
To deploy the stack to your AWS account, type the command:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~

Assuming the deployment was successful, the terminal output includes the domain name of the newly created Application Load Balancer resource:

![][alb]

Copy the name and paste it into a browser tab:

![][root]

The above response confirms the Node-Express API server is running inside the EC2 instance. In the browser, add `api/movies` to the end of the domain name URL: 

![][api]

The response above confirms the API server is successfully communicating with the MongoDB database. 

In the AWS management console, check the stack deployment in CloudFormation:

![][cf]

## Infrastructure State Management.

In the management console, go to the EC2 console and navigate to the security group declared for the EC2 instance by clicking 'Security Groups' on the left panel and then find the group with 'cdk-stack-webserversg' in its name: 

![][secgrp]

The security group currently has one inbound rule defined. To demonstrate the state management feature of the CDK framework and, by implication CloudFormation), in VS Code, open the file `lib/cdk-stack.ts` and uncomment the lines:

~~~ts
    serverSG.addIngressRule(
      Peer.anyIpv4(),
      Port.tcp(22),
      'allow SSH access from anywhere',
    );
~~~
This code adds a second rule to the security group of the server. Redeploy the app using the same command:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
Type 'y' to allow CloudFormation to apply the changes to your deployed resources.

When the deployment is complete, recheck the security group in the AWS management console to confirm the __state change__ has occurred:

![][secgrp2]

## Cleanup

To avoid incurring any cost, destroy the entire stack from your AWS account with the command:
~~~bash
$ cdk destroy
~~~

Go to the Cloudformation service page of the AWS management page and confirm it deleted the stack for this demo app. As well, all the related resources were deleted. For example, check the EC2 instance is removed.
