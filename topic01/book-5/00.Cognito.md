# Cognito Authentication.

In the previous lab we will use the AWS Cognito service to add user authentication to a simple web API. The implementation will provide the following aspects of an application's authentication requirements:

+ SignUP.
+ SignUp confirmation.
+ SignIn.
+ Protected app features.
+ Unauthenticated app features.

### Setup.

Download ann unzip [this archive][start]. Import it into VS Code and type the commands
~~~bash
$ npm install
+ npm run schema
Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
In `lib/auth-app-stack.ts` we create a stack consisting of a Cognito User Pool, an AppClient for this pool, and a skeleton REST API. In the management console, go to Cognito --> User Pools (left panel) to confirm the creation of the user pool:

![][userpool]

Notice in the stack class we declared some private instance variables:
~~~ts
export class AwsServerlessAuthStack extends cdk.Stack {
	private auth: apig.IResource;
	private userPoolId: string;
	private userPoolClientId: string;
~~~
and initialized them in the constructure, for example:
~~~ts
    this.userPoolId = userPool.userPoolId;
~~~
These instance variable are accessible to any other method of the stack class. 
We will have a number of endpoints in the authentication web API that have similar provisioning attributes. A private method in the stack class will reduce code duplication. In `lib/auth-app-stack.ts` define this method as follows:
~~~ts
export class AuthAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  private auth: apig.IResource;
  private userPoolId: string;
  private userPoolClientId: string;

  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    .... as before .....
  }

  private addAuthRoute(
    resourceName: string,
    method: string,
    fnName: string,
    fnEntry: string,
    allowCognitoAccess?: boolean,
    actions?: string
  ): void {
    const commonFnProps = {
      architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
      timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(10),
      memorySize: 128,
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X,
      handler: "handler",
      environment: {
        USER_POOL_ID: this.userPoolId,
        CLIENT_ID: this.userPoolClientId,
        REGION: cdk.Aws.REGION
      },
    };
    
    const resource = this.auth.addResource(resourceName);
    
    const fn = new node.NodejsFunction(this, fnName, {
      ...commonFnProps,
      entry: `${__dirname}/../lambda/auth/${fnEntry}`,
    });

  // if (allowCognitoAccess && actions) {
		// 	fn.addToRolePolicy(
		// 		new PolicyStatement({
		// 			effect: Effect.ALLOW,
		// 			actions: [actions],
		// 			resources: [`arn:aws:cognito-idp:${Aws.REGION}:${Aws.ACCOUNT_ID}:userpool/${this.userPoolId}`],
		// 		})
		// 	);
		// }

    resource.addMethod(method, new apig.LambdaIntegration(fn));
  }  // end private method
}
~~~
You will note that a block of code in the method is commented out - this is intensional and we will enable it later.

Commit this work:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Setup for Auth APII"

### Verified Sender Identities.

By default, an AWS account is in __sandbox mode__. One consequence of this is you can use the SES (Simple Email Service) to send emails to your verified sender identities only, with a typical limit set to 200 emails per day. A verified sender identity is either an email address or domain that you verified ownership of. 

In this application we want to send an email to the user on signup, therefore, you must first add the addresses to your verified sender identities. Follow the steps in [this guide][vsi] to create a  verified sender identity for any emails addresss you have access to.
