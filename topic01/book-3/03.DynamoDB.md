## Simple DynamoDB.

We want to use the CDK framework to create a DynamoDB table. 

in `simple-app-stack.ts` add an import at the top:
~~~ts
import * as dynamodb from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-dynamodb";
~~~
and add a Table declaration (after the function UR statement, although the sequence does not matter):
~~~ts
    const simpleFnURL = simpleFn.addFunctionUrl({
         ... as before ...
    );
    const moviesTable = new dynamodb.Table(this, "MoviesTable", {
      billingMode: dynamodb.BillingMode.PAY_PER_REQUEST,
      partitionKey: { name: "movieId", type: dynamodb.AttributeType.NUMBER },
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
      tableName: "Movies",
    });
~~~
Update the stack by redeploying. In the management console, go to the DynamoDB service and click Tables (left panel). Movies should appear in the table list:

![][dynamodb]

We need to seed the Table as part of the stack deployment. However, the seeding must execute AFTER AWS has created the infrastructure, in particular the Table. The CDK provides the AWSCustomREsource construct for this (and other) edge use cases. An AWSCustomREsource construct can be configured to execute any command, for example the DynamoDB SDK PutItem command to write an item to a table. Internally the CDK __dynamically creates a lambda function__ to perform the task defined by a custom resource. (AWSCustomREsource is an advanced concept and we need not be overly concerned about it after this lab.) 

For convenience we will use some data from the [TMDB web API][tmdb] as our seed data. Create a new folder in the project called `shared`  and add a file called `types.d.ts` with the following content:
~~~ts
export type Language = 'English' | 'French'

export type Movie = {
    movieId: number;
    genre_ids: number[];
    original_language : Language;
    overview: string;
    popularity: number;
    release_date: string;
    title: string
    video: boolean;
    vote_average: number;
    vote_count: number
  }
~~~
Create a new folder in the project called `seed`  and add a file called `movies.ts` with the following content:
~~~ts
import {Movie} from '../shared/types'

export const movies : Movie[] = [
  {
    movieId: 1234,
    genre_ids: [28, 14, 32],
    original_language: 'English',
    overview:
      "Every six years, an ancient order of jiu-jitsu fighters joins forces to battle a vicious race of alien invaders. But when a celebrated war hero goes down in defeat, the fate of the planet and mankind hangs in the balance.",
    popularity: 2633.943,
    release_date: "2020-11-20",
    title: "Title 1234",
    video: false,
    vote_average: 5.9,
    vote_count: 111,
  },
  {
    movieId: 4567,
    genre_ids: [28, 14, 32],
    original_language: 'French',
    overview:
      "Every six years, an ancient order of jiu-jitsu fighters joins forces to battle a vicious race of alien invaders. But when a celebrated war hero goes down in defeat, the fate of the planet and mankind hangs in the balance.",
    popularity: 2633.943,
    release_date: "2020-11-20",
    title: "Title 1234",
    video: false,
    vote_average: 5.9,
    vote_count: 111,
  },
  {
    movieId: 2345,
    genre_ids: [28, 14, 32],
    original_language: 'English',
    overview:
      "Every six years, an ancient order of jiu-jitsu fighters joins forces to battle a vicious race of alien invaders. But when a celebrated war hero goes down in defeat, the fate of the planet and mankind hangs in the balance.",

    release_date: "2020-11-21",
    title: "Title 2345",
    video: false,
    vote_average: 5.9,
    vote_count: 111,
  },
  {
    movieId: 3456,
    genre_ids: [28, 14, 32],

      "Every six years, an ancient order of jiu-jitsu fighters joins forces to battle a vicious race of alien invaders. But when a celebrated war hero goes down in defeat, the fate of the planet and mankind hangs in the balance.",

];

Create the file `shared/util.ts` and add the following code:
~~~ts
import { marshall } from "@aws-sdk/util-dynamodb";
import { Movie } from "./types";

export const generateMovieItem = (movie: any) => {
  return {
    PutRequest: {
      Item: marshall({
        movieId: movie.movieId,
        genre_ids: movie.genre_ids,
        original_language: movie.original_language,
        overview: movie.overview,
        popularity: movie.popularity,
        title: movie.title,
      }),
    },
  };
};

export const generateBatch = (data: Movie[]) => {
  return data.map((e) => {
    return generateMovieItem(e);
  });
};

~~~
Finally, in `simple-app-stack.ts` add some import statements:
~~~ts
import * as custom from "aws-cdk-lib/custom-resources";
import { generateBatch } from "../shared/util";
import {movies} from "../seed/movies";
~~~
and add an AWSCustomResource, as follows:
~~~ts
    const moviesTable = new dynamodb.Table(this, "MoviesTable", {
       ... as before ...
    });

    new custom.AwsCustomResource(this, "moviesddbInitData", {
      onCreate: {
        service: "DynamoDB",
        action: "batchWriteItem",
        parameters: {
          RequestItems: {
            [moviesTable.tableName]: generateBatch(movies),
          },
        },
        physicalResourceId: custom.PhysicalResourceId.of("moviesddbInitData"), //.of(Date.now().toString()),
      },
      policy: custom.AwsCustomResourcePolicy.fromSdkCalls({
        resources: [moviesTable.tableArn],
      }),
    });
~~~
This custom resource has the following characteristics:
+ It only runs when the stack is created, not on subsequent updates (onCreate)
+ Its purpose is to perform a 'batchWriteItem' action on the  DynamoDB service
+ An IAM policy is created and attached to the execution role of the special lambda function. The policy is dynamically created based on the task it must perform, i.e. add item to a table.

Update the stack by redeploying:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
In the management console, go to the DYnamoDB service, click Tables on the left panel, click the Movies hyperlink in the tables list, click the 'Exploe Table Items' button (top right), and scroll down. The items shoul appear, as shown:

![][moviestable]

Commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Create movies table and seed it"
