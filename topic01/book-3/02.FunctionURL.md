## Lambda function URLs.

Function URLs allow us to invoke a lambda function using any HTTP client (e.g. Postman). 

In `lib/simple-app-stack.ts`, add code to cause the creation of a URL for our simple function, as follows:
~~~ts
   const simpleFn = new lambdanode.NodejsFunction(this, "SimpleFn", {
      ... as before ....
    });

    const simpleFnURL = simpleFn.addFunctionUrl({
      authType: lambda.FunctionUrlAuthType.NONE,
      cors: {
        allowedOrigins: ["*"],
      },
    });

    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, "Simple Function Url", { value: simpleFnURL.url });
~~~
The last statement above demonstrates how to output information to the terminal - here, we output the generated URL. Redeploy the app:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
The response should resemble the following:

![][furl]

To test the URL, use a web browser as shown below:

![][browserres]

The URL is also available from the management console. Go to Lambda Service and find the function page as before: 

![][furlconsole]

### Protected URL.

A function URL can be configured as private/protected, so only HTTP requests with a valid authentication token can invoke the function. The AWS SigV4 protocol is the basis for token generation. 

In `simple-app-stack.ts` change the function URL creation statement to the following:
~~~ts
    const simpleFnURL = simpleFn.addFunctionUrl({
      authType: lambda.FunctionUrlAuthType.AWS_IAM,   // CHANGE
      cors: {
        allowedOrigins: ["*"],
      },
    });
~~~
Update the deployment:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
Try submitting the function URL in the browser. The response is a 403 Forbidden access because the request is not appropriately signed. Open the Postman HTTP client (install from [here][postman] ) and create a new HTTP request. Use the URL of the lambda function and set the authentication type to AWS Signature. Use your personal AWS Access key and AWS Secret access key in the settings, as well as eu-west for the region and lambda for the service - see screenshot.

Click Send, and the response should now contain the function's 200 response.
