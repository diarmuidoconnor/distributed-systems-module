## Standalone Lambda.

The first version of our serverless app will be a standalone lambda function.

The file `simple-app/lib/simple-app-stack.ts` was created in the scaffolding step at the start. This file is where we declare the cloud resources for our infrastructure, Replace the content of the file with the following:
~~~ts
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as lambdanode from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';

import { Construct } from 'constructs';
// import * as sqs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-sqs';

export class SimpleAppStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    const simpleFn = new lambdanode.NodejsFunction(this, "SimpleFn", {
      architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64,
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X,
      entry: `${__dirname}/../lambdas/simple.ts`,
      timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(10),
      memorySize: 128,
    });

  }
}

~~~
The 'entry' property in the above lambda function configuration declares points to the file containing the function's code:
>>entry: `${__dirname}/../lambdas/simple.ts`,

Create the folder `simple-app/lambda` and add a file `simple.ts` with the following content:
~~~ts
import { Handler } from "aws-lambda";

export const handler: Handler = async (event, context) => {
  try {
    console.log("I was invoked");
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
      body: { message: "This is a message returned from lambda Function" },
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ error }),
    };
  }
};
~~~
To deploy this CDK stack, the lambda function must be compiled and bundled, a CloudFormation template 
constructed, and both uploaded to AWS. Tyype the following command to achieve this:
~~~bash
$ cdk deploy
~~~
To confirm the deployment, go to the web management console and check the following:
+ The CloudFormation service shows the new stack

![][simplestack]

+ The Lambda service shows the lambda function.

![][simplelambda]

We can also use the AWS CLI to query the Lambda service about our function:
~~~bash
$ aws lambda list-functions      // Type Q o quit
~~~
The simples way to trigger (execute) the function is via the CLI using the command:
~~~bash
$ aws lambda invoke --function-name [function name] response.json
~~~
The function name can be found in the response from the list-functions command, for example:
>$ aws lambda invoke --function-name SimpleAppStack-SimpleFn7D0601E0-znMGo1Ft8A60 response.json

The body of the response from the invocation is stored in a file called `response.json` which is added to the project's file system. It should contain the following:
~~~json
{"statusCode":200,"headers":{"content-type":"application/json"},"body":{"message":"This is a message returned from lambda Function"}}
~~~
[In `.gitignore`, add 'response.json' to prevent it being stored in the repository.]

The output from the console.log statements in the function can be seen in CloudWatch, In the management console, go to CloudWatch --> Log Groups (left panel) --> /aws/lambda/SimpleAppStack-SimpleFnxxxxxx --> Log Stream ( bottom of page - click the most recent stream based on the date stamp, e.g. 2023-07-31 12:39:49 (UTC+01:00) ):
  
![][logstream]

Using log statements to Cloudwatch will be helpful for debugging lambda functions.
